Based on the provided architectural drawings, the project titled "TRANSLUCENT BORDERCROSSING" is a proposal for a new border crossing facility located in Sydney, Canada. The project's main objective is to reconceptualize the international border experience by making it feel more transparent and pleasant. To achieve this, the design proposes the creation of four border crossing stations that are integrated into a ferry route connecting the United States and Canada, shifting the point of entry from a land-based checkpoint to a more integrated, experiential journey.


The architectural plans and sections illustrate a multi-functional complex situated at the water's edge. The facility includes programmatic elements such as a restaurant, garden, pond, and extensive decking, suggesting a focus on public space and amenities alongside official functions. A specific plan details the layout for a "Check Point, Office," indicating the building's role in processing travelers. The design's conceptual development is shown through diagrams illustrating the "EVOLUTION OF FORMS" and "CIRCULATION," which detail the shaping of the building's structure and the planned movement of people through the site.
