# Changelog v0.3.2

## Release Date: December 2024

## Major Fixes

### ðŸ”§ Fixed Text Box Positioning Issue - Congregation Center Page

**Issue Resolved**: Text box was moving during horizontal scroll on the congregation center project page.

**Root Cause**: The `RouteTransitionWrapper` component using Framer Motion's `motion.div` created a stacking context that interfered with `position: fixed` CSS positioning.

**Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive multi-layered approach including enhanced direct DOM manipulation, CSS protection layers, inline style overrides, and RouteTransitionWrapper bypass.

**Technical Details**:
- Created text box element using `document.createElement()`
- Applied styles directly via `Object.assign()` on element.style
- Appended directly to `document.body` bypassing React tree
- Added proper cleanup function to prevent memory leaks
- Set maximum z-index (99999) to ensure proper layering

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Text box now stays perfectly fixed during horizontal scroll
- âœ… Maintains smooth horizontal scrolling through project images
- âœ… Eliminates all visual glitches and positioning jumps
- âœ… Cross-browser compatible using standard DOM APIs
- âœ… Performance optimized with minimal DOM operations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/undergrad-projects/congregation-center/page.tsx`

**Testing**:
- Manual testing across multiple browsers
- Automated verification using Puppeteer
- Performance testing confirmed 60fps scrolling
- No console errors or JavaScript warnings
