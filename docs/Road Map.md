## Development Best Practices

### Working with Cursor AI

**Session Structure**:
1. **Start each session with context**: "I'm replicating the Minale + Mann website. Currently working on [specific feature]. The goal is exact replication."

2. **Be specific in requests**: 
   - ❌ "Add animations to the homepage"
   - ✅ "Add a simple fade-in animation to the hero image using GSAP, matching the existing timeline patterns in TimelineCoordinator.ts"

3. **One feature per session**:
   - Complete and test one feature before starting the next
   - Commit changes after each successful implementation

4. **Use existing patterns**:
   - Reference your existing components and utilities
   - Maintain consistency with your established architecture

### Version Control Strategy

**Branching**:
```
main (production)
└── develop (integration)
    └── mm-replica (replication work)
        ├── phase-1-analysis
        ├── phase-2-static
        ├── phase-3-navigation
        ├── phase-4-animations
        └── phase-5-polish
```

**Commit Strategy**:
- Commit after each successful feature implementation
- Use descriptive commit messages: "MM Replica: Add project grid layout"
- Tag major milestones: "v1.0-static-complete"

### Error Prevention

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to the current phase objectives
2. **Animation Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
3. **Multiple Changes**: One change at a time with Cursor
4. **Insufficient Testing**: Test each change before proceeding

**Recovery Strategy**:
- If Cursor makes unwanted changes, immediately revert to last good commit
- Take breaks between major changes to avoid decision fatigue
- Document any issues for future reference
