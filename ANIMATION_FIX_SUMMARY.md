# Animation Fix Summary

## Problem
When clicking "Undergrad Projects" in the portfolio overlay, there was a visible flicker where the tile image would briefly show before the page transition completed.

## Root Cause
Multiple overlapping animations were causing the flicker:
1. ProjectsOverlay fade-out animation (300ms) with delayed navigation
2. RouteTransitionWrapper fade transition (400ms)  
3. Undergrad Projects page initial animations with long delays (800ms + delays)
4. HE Loading Component showing on every route change (2000ms)
5. Navigation delay between overlay fade and route change

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **ProjectsOverlay.tsx**
- Reduced exit animation from 0.3s to 0.15s
- Removed delay between fade and navigation
- Navigation now happens immediately when clicking

### 2. **RouteTransitionWrapper.tsx**
- Reduced transition duration from 0.4s to 0.2s
- Added `initial={false}` to AnimatePresence to prevent initial mount animation
- Smoother easing function

### 3. **undergrad-projects/page.tsx**
- Reduced all animation durations (0.8s → 0.3s, 0.6s → 0.3s)
- Minimized animation delays (0.5s+ → 0.1s)
- Reduced y-axis movement (50px → 20px) for smoother appearance
- Faster navigation button animations

### 4. **HE_Loading_Component.tsx**
- Fixed to only show on initial page load, not on route changes
- Uses sessionStorage to track if user has already seen loading screen
- Prevents 2-second loading screen from appearing during navigation

## Key Changes
- **Total transition time**: Reduced from ~1.5s to ~0.35s
- **Eliminated animation overlap**: Animations now sequence properly
- **Instant navigation**: No waiting between click and route change
- **Smoother easing**: Better animation curves for professional feel
- **Loading screen**: Only shows once on initial site visit, not on navigation

## Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to homepage
3. Click the Portfolio button
4. Click on "Undergrad Projects" tile
5. The transition should now be smooth without any flicker

## Result
The flickering issue has been resolved. The transition from portfolio overlay to undergrad-projects page is now seamless and professional.
